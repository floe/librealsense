# Windows 8.1 & Windows 10 Installation

**Note:** Due to the USB 3.0 translation layer between native hardware and virtual machine, the librealsense team does not recommend or support installation in a VM.

librealsense should compile out of the box with Visual Studio 2013 Release 4, both Professional and Community editions. Particular C++11 features are known to be incompatible with earlier VS2013 releases due to internal compiler errors.
